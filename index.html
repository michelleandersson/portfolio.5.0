                <p class="about__text">
                    Hi! My name is Michelle Andersson. I'm an American-Swede with a passion for creating beautiful and
                    well-functioning websites.
                    I'm a nature enthusiast with a love for photography and cats. I'm always on the lookout for the next
                    adventure and will jump
                    at any opportunity to grow and learn something new. My passion for web development started as a
                    curiosity for how websites work,
                    which lead to a couple of months spending every free minute I had learning HTML and CSS through Khan
                    Academy.
                    To my great pleasure I was accepted into Pink Programming's intensive course for front end
                    development. I now spend
                    every day working on improving my programming skills and diving deep into the fascinating world of
                    web programming and design.

                                I was contacted by the Karmel nuns in Rydebäck and asked to recreate their website.
                                Their site had not been updated in over 10 years and it was in need of a new design,
                                fresh images, new text, and restructuring the site for better UX. Since the client
                                had no specific design in mind, we spent some time discussing what
                                it was they wanted. I created multiple design options for them and once we arrived at a
                                design they liked, I recreated their whole website with the new design. I also updated
                                their images and text as well as reorganize the website structure. The website is built
                                in Wordpress, however I ended up altering the CSS, JavaScript, and PHP in order to fit
                                the client's needs. Throughout the process I would send updates to the client to ensure
                                I was on track with how they wanted the website to look and function. All in all the
                                whole project took about one month of working on it in the evenings and weekends. In the
                                end the client was very happy with the new website, and ultimately that is what is most
                                important.

                                The page uses MusixMatch API to fetch song information.
                                The page displays the top ten tracks in the US and provides the user with the option to
                                find information for specific
                                songs by searching for them. The results show general information with the ability to
                                show the lyrics for the specific
                                song as well. This page was so much fun because I got to design the whole thing myself
                                from scratch. I designed my own
                                logo, did UX testing, researched the targeted demographic, and made the page responsive.
                                This project was definitely a
                                challenge with the API, but once I got the page to work how I wanted it to, the rest of
                                the page came together quite
                                quickly.

                                The page was created from scratch based on a design in Figma. The project had a deadline
                                that I was not only able
                                to meet, but to finish before the deadline which gave me time to look over the details
                                of the project and work out
                                whatever issues there were before handing in the final project. I am very happy with how
                                this page turned out. I feel
                                the page looks good and functions well. I learned a lot about SlickSliders and how to
                                use and style Google Maps API.

                                best result you may want to zoom out your screen until you get the whole width of the

                                website was created from scratch based on a design in Figma. It was to be fully

                                and sections with content, and be completed within a narrow timelimit. This was one of

                                my timelimit? This was a good challange in finding a balance between getting the page to

                                    <li>Added padding to the title in 'services' and the content of 'testimony' so it

                                <p>"Michelle was part of a project where we built a platform from scratch.
                                    The platform was about teaching newly arrived people about digital transformation.
                                    We created videos about different subjects and Michelle was the one who wrote the
                                    script,
                                    did the translation and added the subtitles. We are very happy to cooperate with
                                    Michelle and we really hope we will do more projects with her. Very professional,
                                    creative and always good communication."

                                    website.
                                    When we met Michelle Andersson we found just that person we had looked for. <br>
                                    She was very attentive and respectful towards our special
                                    way of life in the monastery - full of energy and enthusiasm and eager to do a good
                                    job.
                                    She was very open to our ideas and she showed much patience so that it matched what
                                    we were searching for. She worked very fast and at the same time very thoroughly.
                                    She made
                                    a very beatiful website for us and we are happy and grateful and recommend her to

                                    IT-programing.
                                    Michelle possesses great knowledge within her field, also she has the gift to share
                                    this
                                    knowledge with her students and support them in their intensive program. I found the
                                    IT-programing course material to be of high quality and relevant for what is
                                    requested of an
                                    aspiring developer. <br>
                                    Michelle is a great inspiration to me and has always been there to answer questions
                                    and to
                                    keep me in the right direction to further develop in this field."
